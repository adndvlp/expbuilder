# Project Description

**expbuilder** is a desktop app, Electron-based (electronjs.org), for creating cognitive and behavioral experiments based on the Jspsych framework (jspsych.org). It leverages free resources like Cloudflare Tunnels (for sharing the crafted experiments via self-hosting), and GitHub Pages for hosting with a serverless API (Firebase) to send the experiment results to the user’s Dropbox and/or Google Drive. Jspsych requires code for building experiments, so Expbuilder provides a user interface that translates your experiment design into the code required by Jspsych.

# Features

- Desktop platform based on Electron
- Uses GitHub Pages for free hosting
- **Jspsych** as the main engine for experiment creation
- **Cloudflare Tunnels** for sharing experiments via self-hosting
- Connection to a Firebase project (for free) for data capture and storage
- No coding required, but it can go deeper with code.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adndvlp/expbuilder.git
   cd expbuilder
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

# Development

To run the application in development mode:

1. Start the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   The client will be available at **port 5173** (by default).

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node api.js
   ```

Make sure both processes are running for full functionality.

# Build Instructions

To create a production build of the app:

2. Build the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

3. From the root of the project, build the Electron app:
   ```bash
   npm run build:electron
   ```

# Usage

- **Development mode:** Access the client in your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
- **Production mode:** Use the Electron-generated application (the executable) to run the platform locally.

Follow the on-screen instructions to create and manage your experiments.
